#### ALL

- [x] fade in on scroll

- [ ] MUI options menu needs to register a click on the element if it's ON THE SAME BLOCK, not JUST the text element.
- [ ] Light/Dark mode consistency & styling

- [ ] DESKTOP: Size of button
- [ ] react-reveal shakes on incorrect input

## Notes

- [ ] The sizing is broken for screen sizes bigger than 1440 (e.g. 4K) but I don't care about that. people are going to be viewing this on mobile or desktop.
