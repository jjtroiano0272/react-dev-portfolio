#### ALL

- [x] fade in on scroll
- [ ] DESKTOP: Image sizing
- [ ] Typos
- [ ] Typography standardization: the main title gets h1.title, all others just get h1 in css
- [ ] MOBILE: 'To top' button that appears after scrolling down x far
- [ ] MUI options menu needs to register a click on the element if it's ON THE SAME BLOCK, not JUST the text element.
- [ ] Light/Dark mode consistency & styling
- [ ] Mobile formatting is alright. Desktop formatting is completely busted.
- [ ] Navbar: social links don't have resuable code!

#### Intro

- [ ] Fit background image to rectangle--manually cut it in InkScape
- [ ] Nav links are slightly too big on mobile.
- [ ] Give { WebDev } its own line to ensure consisency

#### Projects

- [x] Gradient overlay
- [ ] Gradient from white to transparent
- [ ] images fill the container (there's one that doesn't and it looks weird)
- [ ] 'Show more' functionality button after 3 projects'

#### Skills

- [ ] Image on mobile has WAY too much margin

#### Certifications

- [x] Oracle 808 description
- [ ] card image padding
- [ ] card margins

#### About

- [x] background repeats

#### Contact

- [x] center input fields
- [x] same width input fields
- [ ] increase padding of fields to allow for animation shakes
- [ ] DESKTOP: Name and email go in same row, side by side
- [ ] DESKTOP: Size of button
- [ ] react-reveal shakes on incorrect input

## Notes

- [ ] The sizing is broken for screen sizes bigger than 1440 (e.g. 4K) but I don't care about that. people are going to be viewing this on mobile or desktop.
