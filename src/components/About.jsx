        choose to return to school in pursuit of Math and IT. As I progressed, I
        found IT most interesting. I was fortunate to get an IT internship where
        I learned about data analysis followed by another internship as an IT
        Tech. That internship turned into regular employment which ended due to
        the Pandemic. I took advantage of the downtime to self educate on web
        development. I have a good body of knowledge and skills in software
        development and I continue learning every day. My hope now is to find a
        job with a good company where I can contribute to its success and my
        greater knowledge level and fulfillment  */}
        After receiving my B.A. in 2015, I found few satisfactory work
        opportunities. I chose to return to school in pursuit of Math & Computer
        Science. As I progressed, I found IT most exquisitely intriguing and
        engaging.
        <br />
        <br />I was fortunate enough to get an IT internship at Gartner in
        Conneticut wherein I learned about Data Analysis, followed by antoehr
        internship as an IT Technician. That internship turned into regular
        employment I loved, which ended due to the pandemic.
        <br />
        <br />I took advantage of the downtime to work hard and self-educate in
        front-end development every day on a set, consistent schedule. This
        continues now, where I am practicing my skill and learning every day.
        <br />
        <br />
        My hope is now to find a job with a solid company where I can contribute
        to its success every day I'm there, and to becoming an ever-stronger
        developer.
